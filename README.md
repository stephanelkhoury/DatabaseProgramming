# SQL Database Programming Project

Welcome to the SQL Database Programming Project! This repository is designed to teach and demonstrate the fundamental and advanced concepts of SQL database programming. It provides a comprehensive learning experience through structured labs, real-world examples, and practical exercises.

## üìö Project Overview

This project is a complete guide to understanding and mastering SQL database programming. It covers a wide range of topics, from basic SQL operations to advanced database management techniques. The repository is organized into multiple sections, each focusing on specific aspects of database programming.

### Key Objectives
- Learn the foundational concepts of relational databases.
- Understand how to design, create, and manage databases.
- Explore SQL commands for data definition, manipulation, and querying.
- Dive into advanced topics like performance optimization, security, and debugging.
- Work on real-world projects to apply your knowledge in practical scenarios.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

The repository is divided into the following sections:

### 1. **Database Programming Wiki**
   - A comprehensive guide to SQL database programming concepts.
   - Organized into chapters covering topics like the relational model, SQL basics, advanced SQL, and DBMS overview.
   - Includes detailed examples and exercises for hands-on learning.

### 2. **Lectures and Labs**
   - A series of lecture-based labs designed to teach SQL programming step by step.
   - Covers topics like data modeling, normalization, indexing, transactions, and more.
   - Each lab includes practical exercises and queries to reinforce learning.

### 3. **Advanced Topics**
   - Focuses on advanced database concepts such as performance optimization, database security, and NoSQL simulations.
   - Includes labs on debugging, stored procedures, triggers, and real-world projects.
