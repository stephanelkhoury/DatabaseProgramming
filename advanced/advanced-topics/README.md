# Advanced Topics

This folder contains a lab that explores advanced database concepts such as partitioning, sharding, replication, and distributed databases.

## Inputs

1. **Partitioning**:
   - Horizontal and vertical partitioning of tables.
   - Example: Splitting an `Inventory` table into partitions.

2. **Sharding**:
   - Distributing data across multiple servers.
   - Example: Simulating sharding with separate tables.

3. **Replication**:
   - Master-slave and multi-master replication.
   - Example: Simulating replication for fault tolerance.

4. **Distributed Databases**:
   - Characteristics and use cases.
   - Example: Simulating distributed queries.
