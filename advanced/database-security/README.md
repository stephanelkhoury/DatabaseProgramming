# Database Security

This folder contains a lab that demonstrates how to secure databases using access control, encryption, and auditing.

## Inputs

1. **Access Control**:
   - Creating roles and granting/revoking permissions.
   - Example: A `ReadOnlyRole` that allows only SELECT operations.

2. **Encryption**:
   - Encrypting sensitive data using AES encryption.
   - Example: Storing and retrieving encrypted data.

3. **Auditing**:
   - Tracking user actions using triggers.
   - Example: Logging INSERT operations on a `Customers` table.

## Lab File
Refer to the `database-security-lab.sql` file for the SQL implementation of these concepts.
