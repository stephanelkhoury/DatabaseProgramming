   - Example: Validating query results for CRUD operations.

2. **Debugging Deadlocks**:
   - Simulating and resolving deadlocks.
   - Example: Handling deadlocks in concurrent transactions.

3. **Constraint Violations**:
   - Handling primary key and foreign key violations.
   - Example: Debugging CHECK and UNIQUE constraints.
