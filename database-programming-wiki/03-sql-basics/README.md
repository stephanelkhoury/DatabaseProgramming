# SQL Basics

This section introduces the basics of SQL (Structured Query Language), which is essential for interacting with relational databases. SQL is used for defining, manipulating, and querying data stored in databases. 

## Objectives
- Understand the fundamental SQL commands for data definition and manipulation.
- Learn how to create tables and define their structure.
- Explore how to insert, update, and delete data in tables.
- Familiarize yourself with various SELECT queries to retrieve data.

## Key Concepts

### Data Definition Language (DDL)
DDL commands are used to define the database structure. The primary DDL command is `CREATE`, which is used to create tables.

### Data Manipulation Language (DML)
DML commands are used to manipulate data within the database. Key DML commands include:
- `INSERT`: Adds new records to a table.
- `UPDATE`: Modifies existing records.
- `DELETE`: Removes records from a table.
- `SELECT`: Retrieves data from one or more tables.

## Examples
In the `examples` folder, you will find SQL files demonstrating the following:

1. **create-tables.sql**: Examples of SQL commands to create tables in a database.
2. **insert-data.sql**: Demonstrations of how to insert data into tables.
3. **select-queries.sql**: Various SELECT queries to retrieve data from tables.
4. **update-delete.sql**: Examples of updating and deleting records in a database.

These examples will help you understand how to effectively use SQL to manage and manipulate data in relational databases.
