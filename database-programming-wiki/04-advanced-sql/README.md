# Advanced SQL Concepts

This section covers advanced SQL concepts that enhance your ability to work with relational databases. We will explore aggregate functions, subqueries, and transactions, which are essential for performing complex data analysis and ensuring data integrity.

## Topics Covered

1. **Aggregate Functions**: Learn how to use functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX to perform calculations on your data.
2. **Subqueries**: Understand how to use subqueries to retrieve data based on the results of another query, allowing for more complex data retrieval.
3. **Transactions**: Discover how to manage transactions in SQL to ensure data integrity and consistency, especially in multi-step operations.

## Examples

- **Aggregate Functions**: Check the `examples/aggregate-functions.sql` file for practical examples of using aggregate functions in SQL queries.
- **Subqueries**: Refer to the `examples/subqueries.sql` file for examples demonstrating how to implement subqueries effectively.
- **Transactions**: See the `examples/transactions.sql` file for examples of transaction management, including COMMIT and ROLLBACK operations.

By mastering these advanced SQL concepts, you will be better equipped to handle complex queries and maintain the integrity of your database operations.
